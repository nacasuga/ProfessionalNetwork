# Internal library version management

This contains version management for internal libraries.
Versions declared here are the default and should be overriden only on a need-to basis
inside the project that needs a different version other than the ones recommended here

This is divided into two sub-modules, namely:

##common-internal-pom
Common data domain library definition. All other internal libraries depend on this

##all-internal-pom
All other internal library definition
