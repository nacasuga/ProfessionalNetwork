# Data domain library

This contains the data domain for the project. It also contains common neo4j extension such as 
UUID generation during entity persistence, annotations to declare the packages containing the
data domain, and external data library dependency declaration.

Versions declared here are the default and should be overriden only on a need-to basis
inside the project that needs a different version other than the ones recommended here

To do that, see example below
